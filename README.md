## Building an application to find and sell laptops, called Laptop Finder.
We have a search page with multiple filters, a listing page, a details page and an FAQ page.

This app is made by using following technologies:
    - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) react framework (bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app)),
    - SQlite database with migration,
    - TypeScript superset for JS,
    - Material-UI library,
    - Axios and others.

## How to run app

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
